# QueryCraft DBMS Project

## Description

The QueryCraft DBMS project is a high-performance database management system designed around the efficiency of binary files for data storage. Our goal is to provide a system that is both fast and reliable, suitable for developers and users requiring efficient data management capabilities. This project is being developed over a 5-week period, with a focus on metadata management, SQL parsing, and a user-friendly command-line interface.

## Project Roadmap and Current Progress

### Completed Steps

- **Research on Binary and Text Files:** Determined binary files as the optimal choice for data storage due to their performance advantages.

- **Metadata Handling Research:** Explored methods for effective metadata management within a DBMS.

- **Metadata Design:** Created a design for serializing table and column information, including names and data types.

- **Parser Implementation:** Developed a parser using JavaCC for processing SQL statements like table creation, data insertion, and data selection, including grammar file testing for SQL statement specification.

### Next Steps

- **Binary File Handling:** To implement advanced functionality for managing binary files for storing serialized metadata and table data.

- **Command Line Interface Design:** To develop a command-line interface for executing SQL commands and table and data operations.

## Features

- High performance through binary file utilization.
- Advanced metadata management system.
- Comprehensive SQL statement parsing.
- User-friendly command-line interface.
