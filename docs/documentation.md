## Introduction

The QueryCraft DBMS project aims to develop a high-performance database management system that utilizes binary files for efficient data storage. Designed to support robust metadata management, SQL parsing, and user interaction through a command-line interface, this project covers the entire system including source code and documentation.

## Project Objectives

- **Efficiency**: Utilize binary files for fast and efficient data storage.
- **Usability**: Provide a user-friendly command-line interface for database operations.
- **Scalability**: Design the system to handle large datasets and complex queries.
- **Robustness**: Ensure the system is resilient and can handle errors gracefully.

## Technical Overview

### Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **Database Storage**: Binary files
- **Interface**: Command-Line Interface (CLI)

### Key Components

- **SQL Parser**: Parses and validates SQL commands.
- **Binary Handler**: Manages binary data operations.
- **Metadata Manager**: Handles metadata for database tables and columns.
- **CLI**: Facilitates user interaction with the DBMS.


## Features

- **SQL Parsing and Execution**
  - Supports `CREATE`, `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations.
- **Metadata Management**
  - Manages information about tables and columns.
- **Binary Data Storage**
  - Efficiently stores data in binary format.
- **Interactive CLI**
  - Provides an easy-to-use interface for executing SQL commands.
